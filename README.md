# RPG # Random Password Generator

This is just a test and is a part of my NOOBS (NOt One BullSh*t) python projects.
And yes, i am a noob, so there's that.

You can also customise the rules of the generated password to your own liking.
The default is :
- At least 1 lowercase character
- At least 1 upper character
- At least 2 numbers
- At least 1 special character

Either excecute the .exe version or use the .py file to run.
No need to install any addtional python package.
Written in python 3.10 using python default library.


TODO :

- Make the GUI version, using tkinter, probably.
- Make this as a chrome extension.
- Password protect the output file.
- and more.....
