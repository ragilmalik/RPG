This is just a test and is a part of my beginner python projects.

You can replace the tkinter part of the code and this will still work.
You can also customise the rules of the generated password to your own taste.
The default is :
- At least 1 lowercase character
- At least 1 upper character
- At least 2 numbers
- At least 1 special character

TODO :
- Add exception if user enters nothing (just pressing the enter without entering anything).
- Make the GUI version using Tkinter
- Make a clickable link to a website
- Password protect the output file
- and more.....
